## Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior. This project applies machine learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest and deep learning (using pre-trained models such as ResNet50) to predict ASD. Additionally, XAI techniques such as SHAP and LIME enhance the interpretability of the models.

## Features
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Combines tabular and image data for ASD detection.
- **Explainable AI**: Provides interpretability using SHAP, LIME, and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM).
- **High Accuracy**: Demonstrates promising accuracy in ASD prediction.
- **Open-Source Dataset**: Utilizes ASD datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
